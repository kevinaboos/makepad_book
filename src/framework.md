# Makepad Framework

The architecture of Makepad Framework is built upon a 3 layer system: Makepad Widgets, Makepad Draw,and Makepad Platform.

Makepad Widgets is the main widget crate which provides standard UI components for development. It sits on top of Makepad Draw.
Makepad Draw is the drawing layer and sits above Makepad Platform.
Makepad Platform is the main platform abstraction layer which interfaces with the various hardware device platforms.

## Makepad Widgets

The Makepad Widgets provides a set of commonly used UI elements toolkit that works with the Makepad ecosystem as part of the Makepad Framework. It is integrated with the Makepad Live Visual Designer and Code Editor to allow manual or visual editing.
