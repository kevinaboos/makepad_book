# Overview

## Makepad Framework

The Makepad Framework, which consists of the cross-platform UI toolkit is designed to be highly modular and flexible, allowing developers to build custom components and tools to suit their specific needs. It also provides a rich set of built-in features such as a 2D/3D graphics engine, a text layout engine.

Due to it's modular design, the Makepad Framework itself can be easily extended by the open source community to build additional functionality and customized components to support a variety of new use cases and projects.

## Makepad Studio (In Active Development)

Makepad Studio is the main application created and built using the Makepad Framework. It consists of two major components, the Visual Live Designer and the Code Editor.

### Makepad Visual Live Designer

The Makepad Live Designer provides live editing capability and real-time collaborative editing system enables multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously.

### Makepad Code Editor

A major part of Studio is the Code Editor. It features a unique "code-folding" capability which allows a quick bird's eye view of the code structure by collapsing and expanding relevant code fragments.

## Makepad Sample Apps

As part of the project, Makepad includes several "sample" applications built using the Makepad Framework. These apps are located in the `/examples` directory under the main Makepad project root.
